It was created for the SLEDA project:

For more details, please read: Interaction Matters: A Three-Level Multi-class English Second Language Conversation Dialogue through Interactive Based Metrics

Dialogues labelled for three levels (from the above paper) can be found in SLDEA data.

Features exacted from the annotated datasets can be found in feature_label.csv. 

Python script data/explore_data.py provides an example of interfacing with the data.
